# The init script sources $INSTALL_DIR/platform/hooks.sh. When that file is
# absent every platform_* function stays the no-op stub the init script
# declares: platform_pre_start() never exports HELIX_CACHE_DIR, and
# platform_stop_competing_uis() leaves the stock UI running. Nothing reports
# either, so a device deploy that forgets the hooks file looks completely
# successful and the difference only shows up as a runtime symptom - on the
# CC1, a cache that lands on tmpfs.
#
# These tests pin that every device deploy target places the hooks file, and
# that the installer's own copy verifies it landed rather than announcing
# success unconditionally.
