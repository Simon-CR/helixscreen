# mk/cross.mk's deploy-common recipe fixes file ownership after rsync (rsync
# preserves the sending host's uid:gid, which on macOS means nothing on the
# device) with a plain `sudo chown`. On a target whose sudo needs a password,
# ssh has no pty to prompt on, sudo fails, and that recipe LINE fails - which
# stops the whole `make deploy-pi` recipe right there, before it ever reaches
# the restart step further down. Every file was already copied; the deploy
# just never restarts the app.
#
# These tests exercise the real deploy-pi recipe with `ssh` and `rsync`
# replaced by loggers on PATH: `chown` and `sudo -n chown` both fail (a device
# with no passwordless sudo), and the assertion is that the recipe still
# reaches and issues the restart command instead of dying on the chown step.
# The second test's mock recognizes any sudo+chown combination, not just the
# post-fix "-n" spelling, so it still catches the pre-fix bare "sudo chown".
