/**
 * @brief Reaches the printer-identify step's printer-change tracking.
 *
 * The step detects once per printer: init_subjects() re-runs detection only
 * while its subjects are uninitialized or when the connected printer's URL
 * differs from the one it last detected. Tests have no Moonraker client, so
 * the URL never changes on its own. Pointing the remembered URL elsewhere
 * makes the next init_subjects() take the production printer-change path:
 * caches dropped, saved name and type cleared, detection run again.
 *
 * Lives in the global namespace to match WizardPrinterIdentifyStep, so the
 * `friend class WizardPrinterIdentifyStepTestAccess;` declaration resolves here.
