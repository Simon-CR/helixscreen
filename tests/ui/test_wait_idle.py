    # non-idle so the two-consecutive-samples rule can never pass on the
    # first (only) sample, and the deadline has already elapsed by the time
    # it's checked. That makes `pytest.raises` alone a tautology — it would
    # pass even if wait_idle always embedded a hardcoded "update_queue=0" in
    # its message. The property actually worth testing is that the embedded
    # counter is a REAL nonzero reading, not just present-looking text.
    #
    # Racing a burst of subject changes (via `scenario printing`/`idle`)
    # against this process's own subprocess-spawn + socket round trip cannot
    # win that reading reliably. The burst shows up in
    # UpdateQueue.pending_count() for at most one drain period (33 ms), because
    # process_pending() drains the ENTIRE queue each time, so there is no way
    # to widen that window from the subject side, and under load spawn latency
    # alone exceeds it. No amount of retrying fixes a per-attempt probability
    # that collapses exactly when the machine is busy enough to make spawning
    # slow.
    #
    # The "http_busy" mock scenario sidesteps the race instead of tuning it:
    # it submits a 2-second synthetic job to HttpExecutor::fast(), whose
    # inflight() counter is incremented at submission and only decremented
    # on job completion (see http_executor.h). That gives wait_idle a
    # multi-hundred-millisecond, load-insensitive window — 2s comfortably
    # exceeds subprocess-spawn latency even under heavy load — so a single
    # sample is enough; no retry loop needed.
