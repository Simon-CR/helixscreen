/**
 * @brief Reference-counted hold that keeps a screen hidden under an opaque overlay
 *
 * A full-screen opaque overlay on lv_layer_top() does not stop LVGL redrawing the
 * panel beneath it: the cover search walks only the active screen, and the top
 * layer is drawn on top of whatever that search found. A hidden screen is skipped
 * by refresh, and invalidations from its descendants are dropped, so hiding it
 * removes that cost. Hiding the screen object does not reflow its children.
 *
 * - The first acquire() records the screen and hides it. A screen that is already
 *   hidden is left as it is and never unhidden by this hold.
 * - Nested acquire() calls only count; the screen they pass is ignored.
 * - The final release() unhides only the screen the first acquire() hid, and only
 *   while it is still a live screen. A screen loaded mid-hold is never touched.
 * - release() without a matching acquire() does nothing.
 *
 * Defined in display_manager.cpp, which every build compiles; the screensaver
 * sources that also take this hold are optional. Main thread only.
