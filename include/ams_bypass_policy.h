 * The firmware value is left untouched so the override can be switched off and
 * reality returns without a re-parse.

/**
 * @brief Whether a bypass toggle should be offered at all on this machine.
 *
 * The two static reasons a toggle is pointless: bypass is not available here,
 * and a hardware sensor owns the bypass so the firmware ignores the command.
 * BypassToggleController refuses on both, so a surface asking this before it
 * draws a toggle cannot offer a control the controller will only refuse.
 *
 * Not yet asked everywhere: the AMS sidebar's bypass_row and the Device
 * Operations row each gate on availability alone, or spell the pair out as two
 * separate XML bindings. On AFC hardware reporting a bypass sensor the sidebar
 * therefore draws a live switch that is refused on every tap.
 *
 * Deliberately NOT including the print guard: that one is live state, so a
 * toggle stays drawn and goes disabled rather than vanishing mid-print.
