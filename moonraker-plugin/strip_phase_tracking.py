"""
Strip HELIX_TRACKING marker blocks from a Klipper config tree.

HelixScreen versions before 1.1 could instrument a PRINT_START macro with
calls to HELIX_PHASE_*/HELIX_READY, each call wrapped in a pair of marker
comment lines. This script undoes that: it walks a config directory, finds
every well-formed marker block sitting inside a [gcode_macro ...] body, and
removes it, backing up each file it edits first.

A file with any marker anomaly (unmatched or nested markers, a marker line
outside a gcode body, a block that is not exactly the three lines the
instrumentation ever wrote) is left byte-for-byte untouched; only its path
and the reason are reported. Nothing here restarts Klipper - the caller is
told the edit takes effect at the next restart.

Usage: strip_phase_tracking.py CONFIG_DIR
Exit status: 0 if every file was clean or fully stripped; 2 if nothing
failed but at least one file was skipped (an anomaly, or a concurrent
change) and needs a human to look at it; 1 if any file's edit failed
outright.

    that same listed path, not from whatever it resolves to.

    what matters: it is the only way the hint's backup name can point at a
