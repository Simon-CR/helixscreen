# Lint gate: overlay width is decided at push time, never in XML.
#
# Background (#1178). theme_manager registers two overlay widths:
#
#   overlay_width_transient    = screen - nav - space_lg
#   overlay_width_destination  = screen - nav
#
# They are not spacing options. A destination occludes the backdrop entirely —
# it is a place you park, and its drill-downs are part of it. A transient layer
# leaves the backdrop showing at the leading edge — you opened it over something
# and will return.
#
# Which one an overlay gets depends on HOW THE USER REACHED IT, not on the
# overlay itself. fan_control_overlay is a transient layer when opened from
# Controls and a drill-down when opened from Settings > Fans. power_panel and
# settings_sensors have the same split. No static `width=` attribute can be
# correct for those, so NavigationManager::push_overlay() resolves the class
# against the live stack and writes the width.
#
# Before the gate existed, authors picked a constant by hand. 20 panels ended up
# gapped and 36 full with no stated rule, `overlay_panel.xml` defaulted to the
# minority variant so new panels silently inherited the wrong look, and
# console_settings_overlay rendered 16px WIDER than the console_panel it was
# pushed from.
#
# WHAT IS FLAGGED
#   1. Any XML naming #overlay_width_destination. Destination-ness is declared
#      in C++ by IPanelLifecycle::is_destination(), never in markup.
#   2. A navigation width constant passed as `width=` to an element that
#      extends overlay_panel. The component already bakes in the transient
#      width; push_overlay upgrades it. Hand-picking either constant there is
#      the exact mistake that produced #1178.
#
# NOT FLAGGED
#   - Hand-rolled overlay roots (extends="lv_obj" with align="right_mid") using
#     width="#overlay_width_transient". Those predate the overlay_panel
#     component and still need a born-width, because setup() runs before the
#     push and several of them measure their own layout there. They may name
#     the transient constant and nothing else.
#   - A deliberate custom width on an overlay_panel — widget_catalog_overlay is
#     width="70%" so the home grid stays visible behind it. Neither navigation
#     class applies. Such an overlay MUST call
#     NavigationManager::set_overlay_width_unmanaged() or push_overlay will
#     overwrite the width it chose.
