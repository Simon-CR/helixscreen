"""What a `--staged-only` gate must read: the INDEX, not the working tree.

A `--staged-only` gate exists so the pre-commit hook checks what the commit
will actually contain. Picking the file list from `git diff --cached
--name-only` and then reading each path with `open()` / `Path.read_text()`
gets the SET right and the CONTENT wrong: that call reads whatever is on disk
right now, which is the staged blob only until something touches the working
tree again. Stage a violation, then revert the working copy to something
clean - the file list still names the file, but every gate built this way
reads the clean copy and reports nothing. The bad blob commits.

This module reads the staged blob instead, via one `git cat-file --batch`
process for every path a gate cares about, so nine gates stop hand-rolling
nine copies of the same subprocess dance.

    from staged_content import staged_files

    for path, text in staged_files(suffixes=('.bats',)):
        ...

`staged_files()` covers the common case: the set of files worth checking IS
the staged diff, and each one is a per-file rule (a duplicate name, a bare
`[[ ]]`, an unguarded subscript) that never needs to see a file that did not
change. That is every gate in this module's first set of callers.

A gate whose count is a WHOLE-TREE ratchet (check_hardcoded_pixels.py,
check_panel_widget_scrollable.py) needs a different shape: every file in the
tree the commit will produce, not just the changed ones, so an unrelated
file's pre-existing violations still count toward the baseline. Those two
build that tree with `git write-tree` + `ls-tree`, then read it through
`catfile_batch()` below - the file SET is a different question from this
module's `staged_paths()`, so it is not duplicated here, but the READ
primitive is shared.

    Requests are written one at a time, each followed by a `flush()` and an
    immediate read of that request's response, before the next request is

    once the path list is large enough: git's stdout fills the OS pipe
    buffer (a few dozen KB) before this process finishes writing, git blocks
    on that full pipe, and this process's own stdin write then blocks too -
    neither side is reading the other free, forever. A label with no blob at
